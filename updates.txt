This file will be used to keep the creators of Towerbound up-to-date as to the project's status without having to understand a programming language or such.

Queries:
	Should named hybrids (i.e. Centaur, Naga) be classified as hybrids or a unique species?
Missing data:
	CRITICAL DATA GAP: No data for Jadebot. Like, at all.
	MINOR CONTRADICTION: thetiniestcancer stated in tags that Tavros was stuck inside Vriska's scepter, but later character lists refuted this claim.
		POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
			Straight override of old data
			themegamaryam suggests a cloning as a possible reason (Sources/primarySources.txt, Fanmail A)
Ideas:
	Add a relevant quote to each character's page? (see "quotes" branch)
	"Go back" button might need to be smaller?
	Variable table colours based on the character?
To-do:
	Re-order character page so that the info table appears to the right of the descriptive text
	Try an anti-aliased "go back" button
	Change "go back" button to "up one step" button to better reflect actual functionality
	Create pages for all characters
	Create and organize other main two menus and sub-menus (waaaaay down the line here)
	Procure a clean version of the world map from themegamaryam
	Organize my local files (wow they are all over the place god damn)
