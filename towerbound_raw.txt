	Description:
		My shitty drawing skills aside, this is what the towerbound universe and all of it’s various planes look like in relation to each other, although they are not necessarily to 100% scale.
		The actual universe is the large blue orb in the center, while the 12 god’s personal planes exist outside of that orbiting like moons. The black emptiness in between each plane is actually the “domain” of Rose, as she takes claim over all of the void between each one.
		The red ring around each plane is owned by caliborn and is quite larger than any of the trolls or humans as his roles require more space for defaulted sinners who didn’t claim an afterlife beforehand.
		The vast green plane outside all others belongs to calliope; hers is far larger than everyone else’s combined to an extent not even accurate in this image, both because she has more souls than most in her afterlife and also because as the goddess of space and matter she has a lot of space naturally. In fact her physical body is larger than any single thing in existence, and she must make avatars to enter other planes on her behalf because she couldn’t get small enough to enter on her own even if she tried.
		Jade, having ascended after the gods were already formed, did not have her own plane at first; but Calliope granted her a small chunk of her own realm to her.
		The tiny white bubble around the others is not owned by any one deity, but serves two purposes as both the intermediary for traveling souls before they reach their correct afterlife, and the meeting area for the gods.
