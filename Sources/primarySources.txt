((Ok, read your list.
That towerbound character post that TTC wrote was actually an “as-of-now” list; and as time has gone on they have evolved and changed.
The list I wrote should be the most up-to-date list as of now, although i should update it soon with new characters that have come about from questions.
So all of the contradicions with Calliope, Caliborn and most of the others are answered by that.

As for Tavros: the real tavros is a Bovus (which do you think sounds better, bovus or bovum?).
Possible idea: Vriska attempted to create a cloning spell and used it on tavros (she snatched some hair when she saw him at a tavern), but instead of a normal 10-foot tavros he was only a few inches. She keeps him as a familiar she often keeps in her scepter.

Fanmail B:
Birth order is correct.

Unsure about ages however: I think Karkat & fef are in early to mid twenties, Gamzee late twenties, and Meenah and Kurloz early thirties (still look early twenties ‘cause lifespan).

Karkat: 24
Feferi: 24
Gamzee: 29
Kurloz: 33
Meenah: 36

Fanmail C:
((that green sun comment is pretty cool. I don’t know if it should be canon, but the parallels you draw certainly would work. I could certainly retcon my towerbound universe expenation and go with yours instead; or the towerbound universe could appear to be a green sun, just be located out farther away from most other universes (possibly camouflage to avoid notice by other universes or entities?). We’ll think more about it later maybe.

I read your updates and think it’s coming along smoothly. Roxy’s species would probably be “Human Demi-god” or something like that; Rose’s mom is the progenetor of all humanity along with the Dolorosa, and while Roxy may have the appearance of a human because of her mother’s Genes(can gods have genes?), she is far different due to her direct link to her mother.
Also should there be an age category?

Fanmail E: 
No, mutants aren’t subject to much more stigma then say someone who’s double-jointed. Without the hemospectrum’s oppressive category system, mutants are free to simply live like anyone else.

Fanmail F:
((Probably geocentric, as the world was the primary focus of the gods when they made the universe.))

Fanmail G:
I would guess her stomach has similar fortitude like her skin does, and a dragons stomach acid would probably be hotter and more powerful then other beings; maybe strong enough to quickly neutralize anything left alive.

Ask Tree A:
INAV: 5000 miles you say? But the Earth's exosphere terminates at 480km, so 3218688/480000 * 100 = the planet's atmosphere is 670.56% taller than Earth's. Without an increase in air pressure, this would mean the planet's mass must be smaller than Earth's, which considering it's meant to be 2x Earth's radius seems odd. Even if mass is the same as Earth's, density seems suspect: p = m/((4*pi*r^3)/3) gives bogus values.
MM: What explanation would you give yourself to fix the issue? Maybe the gods never “programmed” the void to be unbreathable?
INAV: As for the atmospheric height thing, there's a number of ways we could solve it.
	1: Terezi doesn't need air - she photosynthesizes, like plants do. In addition, her thick skin/scales/whatever prevents the pressure difference from ripping her apart.
	2: The atmosphere doesn't get thinner with altitude, but instead extends all throughout the mortal plane.
	3: Through magic, Terezi is surrounded by a layer of air at ASL pressure at all times, i.e. a spacesuit without the suit.
MM: I like the third one, if you don't mind i'll go retcon that into canon.
